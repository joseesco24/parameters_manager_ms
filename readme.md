# Parameters Manager Ms

Parameters Manager MS is a simple parameterization microservice based on Rust, its main function as its name suggest is to manage system parameters consumed by other backends throught APIs.

The project uses Rust for everything that concerns the microservice, but the repo also has some npm commands and uses husky hooks to automate and make easy some dev tasks, so the project also uses npm.
